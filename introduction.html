            <p class = "events"> For over 50 years, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has been a cornerstone of global energy security, working to prevent, address, and manage energy supply disruptions and crises. As the global landscape evolves, so do the challenges associated with energy security. <br> <br /> On 24 and 25 April 2025, the IEA, in collaboration with the UK government, will host the International Summit on the Future of Energy Security at Lancaster House in London. This invitation-only event will be co-chaired by the UK Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, Ed Miliband, and the IEA Executive Director, Fatih Birol, both of whom will deliver keynote addresses. <br> <br /> The Summit will explore the geopolitical, technological, and economic dimensions influencing energy security at both national and international levels. It will offer a platform for global leaders and decision-makers to assess the trends shaping energy security and to deliberate on strategies for addressing both traditional and emerging risks. Key areas of focus will include shifts in the demand, supply, and trade of major fuels; the increasing integration of electricity within energy systems; the expansion of clean energy technologies and their supply chains; and the critical availability of minerals and metals essential for clean energy solutions. </p>

            <p class = "events"> The International Energy Agency (IEA) will convene its 10th Annual Global Conference on Energy Efficiency on 12 and 13 June 2025 in Brussels. Co-hosted by Dr. Fatih Birol, IEA Executive Director, and Dan JÃ¸rgensen, European Commissioner for Energy and Housing, the event is organized in partnership with the Energy Efficiency Movement. This milestone event takes place at a critical juncture, as global governments have committed at COP28 to doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030. Achieving this ambitious target is essential for creating a secure, sustainable, and affordable clean energy system aligned with international climate goals. However, significant acceleration is required to meet this objective. <br> <br /> The conference will serve as a premier platform in 2025 for Ministers, CEOs, and senior leaders to collaborate and strategize on achieving this efficiency goal. Discussions will focus on maximizing the role of energy efficiency in enhancing consumer affordability, industrial competitiveness, and energy security across all regions. Over two days, attendees will participate in high-level panels, roundtable discussions, workshops, and meetings to drive policy development and unlock investments in energy efficiency. Key highlights include a ministerial roundtable, chaired by the co-hosts, where government representatives will address strategies for advancing global progress. </p>
